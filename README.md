Before running the code use the code below to download and install all the required libraries using the terminal:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sentence-transformers bertopic pillow streamlit


First, run the train code to create the embeddings, metadata, model, and the topics in the  'saved_trains' which will be used to generate output
NOTE: if the training code takes too long, try reducing the number in "df.head(<insert number here >)" which should make the code run faster, make sure to do the same for the testing code too

Second, run the testing code to generate graphs 

Third, either type 'streamlit run streamlit.py' in the terminal to run the app locally or use the link below to access the app to see a clearer graph output. However, the graphs should be visible on the testing code 
file too
